<p>I decided to do my CLI project on the video game Hearthstone, which is a trading card game by Blizzard. I enjoy playing games in my spare time as a hobby, anything from trading card games to table top games to video games. My favorite trading card game is Magic the Gathering, but the best API I could find was for Hearthstone, so i decided to go with it. After looking through the API and what data it had to offer i decided what i wanted to do was make my project into a card searcher. Using the API information a user would be able to look up any card in the game by its set and then view the information of the card. After a good amount of trial and error and troubleshooting I was able to make it work! This project definitely pushed me to learn more to achieve what I wanted. Reflecting on what I have as my final product I'm thinking of ways that I could refactor better or write my code cleaner. Moving forward from this project I want to push myself to learn more and be ready for the next project! </p>.
