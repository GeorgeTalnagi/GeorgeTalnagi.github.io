    I don't think it was any one thing that led me to decide to learn to code, but rather a few things.
		I have had an interest in coding since the myspace/facebook days and used the IRC chat client,
		messing around with basic HTML. I never really understood much of it but always wanted to. 
		I also had a chance to take a few computer classes throughout highschool / college but none
		that really dove into REALLY learning how to code, but again i was always interested in computers
		and software.

    About 2 years ago my best friend decided to do a coding bootcamp and got a job as a software developer. Watching him go through it and find a job that he really loves has been a huge motivation for me to want to do the same. He turned me onto FlatIron and after doing some homework i decided the time was now and FlatIron was the place. I have been bartending the past few years and came to the conclusion that I am not happy doing it, but rather have just been working a job to pay the bills. Coding for me is a way for me to pursue something that i believe I will enjoy doing and provide me with a better life. I am excited to work through this bootcamp and challenge myself and am looking forward to a better tomorrow!
