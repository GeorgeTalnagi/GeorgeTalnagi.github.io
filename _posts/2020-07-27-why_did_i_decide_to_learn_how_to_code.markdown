I've always had an intrest in coding and have used a few free coding websites. About 2 years ago my best friend began working as a software engineer and i have talked to him a lot about it since then. These conversations only validated my interests in coding and made me want to learn more and more. So here I am, finally taking the plunge! I am excited to challenge myself and make a positive change in my life!
